# Idealist
Tool for anonymous proposition and rating of good ideas

## Core concepts
 - Admins can remove ideas and archive current session
 - Anyone can anonymously post their idea
 - Anyone can vote once on any of the ideas (in the current session only)
 - Every idea gets 1 bonus vote once it gets posted (the author can vote for it later if she/he wants to)
